<h1><center>Download Rocky!</center></h1>
<h2><center>Rock, Paper, Download!</center></h2>
<p>Since this is version 0.1, Rocky isn't a .exe file. It is a .py file. Stupid Right?</p>
<p>Anyway. Since Rocky is still a .py file, you will need to install Python (If you don't have it already.)</p>
<p>Simply go to <a href="https://python.org/">The Python Website</a></p>
