<h1><center>Download Rocky!</center></h1>
<h2><center>Rock, Paper, Download!</center></h2>
<p>Since this is version 0.1, Rocky isn't a .exe file. It is a .py file. Stupid Right?</p>
<p>Anyway. Since Rocky is still a .py file, you will need to install Python (If you don't have it already.)</p>

<p> After you've installed Python on your PC, you now need to download Rocky.</p>

<p>Also, if you would like the source code, feel free to go the same page put instead of clicking the main file, click on the source code file and download it as a zip file for Windows or a tar.gz file for Linux.</p>
<p>Another way to download Rocky is to download Git and if you don't know what Git is then this method isn't for you.</p>
<p>After you've installed Git, open CMD on your PC and once you are in CMD, you need to cd into the place you want to install Rocky.</p>
<p>For example, cd C:\Users\(Your user name)\Desktop</p>
<p>After you have got yourself into the folder, type the following command:</p>
<p>git clone https://github.com/DaRealSqueaky/Rocky</p>
<p>Once you have ran that command, wait until it is done.</p>
<p>That command should've created a folder in the place you cloned the repository into called "Rocky" and rocky.py should be inside it. </p>
<h1>THAT'S YOU DONE!!!</h1>
